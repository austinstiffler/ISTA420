1. You would want to join two (or more) tables together if you need to use the relational algebra term *selection* to select a column(s) from different a table and use it in the same query as the queried table.

1. An *inner join* will return rows between multiple tables where there is a column match in both tables being queried, then filters based on a predicate specified.

1. An *outer join* will return rows where there is a match in both tables being queried; but also will return the left, right, or full rows where there is not a match, based on specification of what is being preserved.

1. A *cross join* will return each row from one table that is matched with all rows from the other.

1. What's round on each end and hi in the middle? Ohio!

1. A *composite join* would be used when you need to match multiple attributes from each side.

1. The first query will count every customer, even those who have not placed orders. The second query will count only customers that have placed orders.

1. It does not match the where predicate.
