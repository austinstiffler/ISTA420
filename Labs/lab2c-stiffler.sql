-- 1. List the employee IDs with the number of sales by each employee from most sales to least. I want to recognize the employees with the most sales.
select employeeid, count(orderid) from orders group by employeeid order by count(orderid) desc;


-- 2. I want to look at the average discounts taken by all customers for products that cost more than $50.00. Specifically, I want to know the average discount of all orders for each product from the highest price to the lowest price.
select productid, unitprice, printf("%.2f", avg(discount)) as average_discount from order_details where unitprice > 50 group by productid order by unitprice desc;

-- 3. I am doing an analysis of which shippers ship to each country, and I need a report showing the number of orders each shipper delivered to each country and the nuber of orders. I donâ€™t need the data where the number of orders is ten or
-- less, but I need the report listed by country and the number of orders shipped to that country.
select shipcountry, count(orderid) as total_orders, shipperid from orders group by shipperid, shipcountry having count(orderid) > 10 order by shipcountry, count(orderid) desc;

-- 4. For each order, what was the time lag between the order date and the ship date?
select orderid, orderdate, shippeddate, julianday(shippeddate) - julianday(orderdate) as lag from orders order by lag desc;

-- 5. Continuing with the previous query, I need the average time lag for each shipper.
select shipperid, avg(julianday(shippeddate) - julianday(orderdate)) as lag from orders group by shipperid order by lag;

-- 6. I am doing inventory, and I need to know the total price of each product on hand, that is, the price of each product line, sorted alphabetically by product name.
select productid, productname, unitsinstock, unitprice, unitsinstock * unitprice as total from products where unitsinstock > 0 order by productname;

-- 7. What is the dollar total we have tied up in inventory?
select sum(unitsinstock * unitprice) from products;

-- 9. How many days were in the service (if you are a veteran), or how many days will you serve (assuming you know your ETS date)?
select julianday('2021-05-06') - julianday('2015-05-07');
